## Space animation

This project is a small frontend demo dedicated to the theme of space exploration. The main goal is to learn and practice visual effects, animations and interactive elements using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 🚀 About the project

The project implements a stylized web page with thematic content about space, supplemented with animations and effects. This is a training work aimed at practicing the following skills:

- creating adaptive layout;
- working with CSS animations and transitions;
- using JavaScript for basic interactivity;
- improving visual perception of the page.

Backend is **not used in the project** - all functionality is implemented on the client side.
